# INFO 5940 
Welcome to the INFO 5940 repository. You will complete your work using [**GitHub Codespaces**](#about-github-codespaces) and save your progress in your own GitHub repository. This guide will walk you through setting up the development environment and running the test notebook.  

## Getting Started 

### Step 1: Fork this repository 
1. Click the **Fork** button (top right of this page).
2. This will create a copy of the repo under **your own GitHub account**.

Forking creates a personal copy of the repo under **your** GitHub account.  
- You can commit, push, and experiment freely.  
- Your work stays separate from the official class materials.

### Step 2: Set your OpenAI API key

This class uses Cornell's **AI API Gateway**. See
[AI API Gateway](https://confluence.cornell.edu/spaces/citai/pages/541787315/AI+API+Gateway)
for details on the service and how to obtain your key.

Your API key is a **secret**. Never paste it into a file in this repository — your
fork is public, and a committed key is a leaked key.

Instead, store it as a GitHub Codespaces secret. GitHub injects it into the
environment automatically, and it never touches the filesystem.

1. Go to [**github.com/settings/codespaces**](https://github.com/settings/codespaces).
2. Under **Codespaces secrets**, click **New secret**.
3. Set:
   - **Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** the key you received for the class
4. Under **Repository access**, select your fork of this repository.
5. Click **Add secret**.

> Set the secret **before** creating your Codespace. If you have already created
> one, the secret only appears after you rebuild it:
> **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P** → **Codespaces: Rebuild Container**.

You do not need to set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` — the Codespace points it at the
Cornell [AI API Gateway](https://confluence.cornell.edu/spaces/citai/pages/541787315/AI+API+Gateway)
for you.

<summary><b>Working outside Codespaces?</b> (optional — most students can skip this)</summary>

If you run the notebooks on your own machine instead of in a Codespace, there is
no Codespaces secret to inject, so use a local `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and fill in your key. `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so it
will not be committed.

In a Codespace the secret takes priority — `.env` is only ever a fallback, so
having both is safe.

### Step 3: Open your forked repo Codespace
1. Go to **your forked repo**.
2. Click the green **Code** button and switch to the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Select **Create Codespace**.
4. Wait a few minutes for the environment to finish setting up. The terminal
   prints `==> Setup complete.` when it is done, and warns you if your API key
   is missing.

### Step 4: Verify your environment
Once the Codespace is ready:
1. Open `test.ipynb`.
2. Click **Run All**.
3. All four cells should print a ✅, ending with a reply from the model.

The Python 3.11 interpreter is preselected, so you should not need to choose a
kernel manually. If VS Code does ask, pick **Python 3.11.13**.

If a cell fails, its message says what to fix — most often a missing API key
(Step 2).

## About GitHub Codespaces

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) is a complete software development and execution environment, running in the cloud, with its primary interface being a VSCode instance running in your browser.

Codespaces is not free, but their per-month [free quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-quota) is generous.  Codespaces is free under the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#github-codespaces).

### Codespaces Tips

* Codespaces keep running even when you close your browser (but will time out and stop after a while)
* Unless you're on a free plan, or within your free quota, costs acrue while the codespace is running, whether or not you have it open in your browser or are working on it
* You can control when it's running, and the space it takes up.  Check out [GitHub's codespaces lifecycle documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/understanding-the-codespace-lifecycle)

## Sync Updates 
To make sure your personal forked repository stays up to date with the original class repository, please follow these steps:
1. Open your forked repo.
2. At the top of the page, you should see a banner or menu option that shows whether your fork is behind the original repo.
3. Click the **Sync fork** button.
4. In the dropdown, choose **Update branch** to pull the latest changes from the original repo into your fork.

Optionally, you can also follow these steps to create a new branch on your fork:
1. Open your **forked repository** on GitHub.  
2. At the top of the page, next to the branch dropdown, click the **Branches** button.  
3. In the **Branches** view, click the green **New Branch** button.  
4. In the popup window, enter a branch name.  
   - You can use any name you like, but it’s recommended to match the branch name used in class for better organization.  
5. Under **Branch source**, select:  
   - **Repository:** `AyhamB/INFO-5940-Codespace`  
   - **Branch:** choose the branch you want to sync from (e.g., `streamlit`).  
6. Click the green **Create New Branch** button.  
7. Verify that you’re now back in **your fork**, on the new branch you just created.  
8. Click the **Code** button and create a new Codespace (if you don’t already have one).  
   - Make sure the Codespace is created from the **current branch**.
  
## Running a Streamlit App on Codespaces  

Follow these steps to launch and view your Streamlit app in GitHub Codespaces:

1. **Open the terminal** inside your Codespace.  

2. Run the command:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run your-file-name.py
   ```  
   *(Replace `your-file-name.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit app file, e.g., `hello_app.py`.)*  

3. After pressing **Enter**, Codespaces forwards port **8501** and opens the app
   in a new browser tab.

   *If the tab does not open:* go to the **Ports** tab in the bottom panel, find
   **Streamlit App** on port 8501, and click the globe icon to open it.

4. **Make changes to your code** in the Codespace editor.
   - Refresh the browser tab to see the updated version of your app.  


## Troubleshooting

**`OPENAI_API_KEY is not set`**
The Codespaces secret is missing or was added after this Codespace was created.
Check Step 2, then run **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** from the command palette.

**The API call in `test.ipynb` returns an authentication error**
The secret exists but the value is wrong or incomplete. Re-enter it at
[github.com/settings/codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces),
confirm your fork is selected under **Repository access**, and rebuild.

**A package is missing**
Rerun the setup from the terminal:
```bash
bash ./.devcontainer/setup.sh
```

**No Python kernel offered in the notebook**
Left sidebar → **Extensions** → confirm **Python** and **Jupyter** are installed,
then reload the window.

**Never commit your key.** `.gitignore` excludes `.env` files, but the safest
approach is the Codespaces secret above, which never creates a file at all.
